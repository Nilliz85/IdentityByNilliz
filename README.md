# School Year 1 Project Exam Info

The assignment for the final exam of year 1. At Noroff School of Technology & Digital Media

A New Portfolio Website

The final exam assignment of year 1 is creating a blog about a topic of our choosing. i desided to make this Blog about my "journey" to becoming a frontend developer. and life in the tech business, and to use this as a part of my Portfolio. this page will according to the assignment@s criterias be a headless wordpress site which i then build from the ground up using what i learned in HTML/CSS and javascript, but also the different design courses we have gone through.

**this page will develop over time as this will be a running sideproject that i use to train my skills but also let the world know about my experiences etc.** <br>
**i didnt get the modal to work properly as i didnt manage to get the api call to fetch the image and render it like it should. dont really know where the problem is**
